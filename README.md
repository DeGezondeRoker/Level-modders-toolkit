# Level modder's toolkit
 General objects to spice up your level mods. You are completely free to use and modify these and to merge them with any mods you make. All objects have custom SonLVL definitions meaning you don't have to stare at a screen filled with [?].

# Usage
 Simply Merge the mod's Data folder with your own mod and merge the SonLVLObjDefs folder with its corresponding folder in the root of your decomp. Make sure you include the SonLVL.gif in Data/Sprites/Toolkit, or else the definitions won't display correctly. At no point is this file loaded during gameplay so it has no impact on the limited VRAM.
 Vanilla scripts that need to be modified to make certain objects work are in their own folder (Data/ModifiedScripts). If your mod does not contain any script edits, you can freely merge the contents of this folder with your mod's Scripts folder. If your mod does already contain edits for scripts in this mod, you must manually copy over the modifications. Use your editor's word search for "EDITED FOR TOOLKIT" to find every line added or modified by this mod.

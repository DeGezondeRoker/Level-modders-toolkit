# Level modder's toolkit
 General objects to spice up your level mods. You are completely free to use and modify these and to merge them with any mods you make. All objects have custom SonLVL definitions meaning you don't have to stare at a screen filled with [?].

# Usage
 Simply Merge the mod's data folder with your own mod and merge the SonLVLObjDefs folder with its corresponding folder in the root of your decomp. Make sure you include the SonLVL.gif in Data/Sprites/Toolkit, or else the definitions won't display correctly. At no point is this file loaded during gameplay so it has no impact on the limited VRAM.
